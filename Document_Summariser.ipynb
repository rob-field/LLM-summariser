              "'Welcome to Health Literacy Out Loud. I’m Helen Osborne, President of Health Literacy Consulting, founder of Health Literacy Month and author of the book Health Literacy from A to Z. I also produce and host this podcast series, Health Literacy Out Loud.\\nthe introduction of artificial intelligence, or AI. I’m certainly grappling with how to best use it as a tool in health communication.\\nThanks for having me.\\nThis AI, it’s here. I’m reading about it everywhere. Clue us all in. What is AI, and what do we need to know and do?\\nAI isn’t new. We’ve had artificial intelligence for a while, and I’ll get to what that is in a second.\\nI think that’s what really overwhelmed me. As you talk about it, that it’s been around for a while, that’s probably why if I’m looking for a pair of sneakers, all of a sudden those very same sneakers show up on my computer. It’s like, “Really?”\\nExactly.\\nBut now you’re saying it can not only give us back information we somehow entered into it, but it can create something new. I think that’s the part I find awesome scary.\\nFor example, news organizations even back in 2016 and 2017 were using AI to write stories for sports and finance.\\nThey were?\\nFinance stories look the same. It’s basically reading the market. They said, “Why are we asking somebody to write that when we can ask a computer to write that?”\\nWhy did it change and what do we need to know about it? It seems all the rage.\\nFundamentally, this is about money. What’s been happening in the background is Microsoft, Google and others, OpenAI, they’ve been trying to create these tools for the public as a way to mass market, mass distribute this technology.\\nI find it scary awesome.\\nYou’re absolutely right. Even with ChatGPT 3, that’s the free version. There’s ChatGPT 4, which you have to pay a monthly subscription for.\\nI saw something like that just this morning. I was dealing with my newsletter, and now the company that does the newsletter said, “You want to use our AI tool?”\\nExactly.\\nI’ve been hedging away from this. I am looking on from the sidelines. It’s why I wanted to talk with you so much. I don’t know what I should or shouldn’t be doing, but I also want to be talking with you specifically about it as a tool of health communication.\\nThere are some incredible ways that AI in particular can help. For example, I can put a body of text into ChatGPT and say, “Can you rewrite this at a Grade 5 level?” or, “Can you rewrite this in Spanish?”\\nYou’re generating all these different questions. Many of us serve as plain language writers and editors. Is our work done? Will the robots take over?\\nThere’s no denying that there are certain jobs that AI is going to take away. In fact, yesterday I had somebody who’s a voiceover artist saying, “Nobody wants my services anymore at the lowest level.” She said, “No computer is ever going to take away my creativity, but the people who want to pay small amounts for small jobs, I’m no longer getting hired.”\\nI’d like to think that maybe the first pass of doing something in plain language might be taken care of by the computer. But we know our audience, we respect our audience and we understand the nuances of health information. I would hope that our role would be to massage that, to look for accuracy, to vet the sources.\\nThey’re constantly learning. Exactly.\\nHow do we vet that content? I’m not ready to give up my role as a plain language writer. I am just not there. Maybe you are, but I’m going to be very reluctant and skeptical about that. I think humans offer something that computers can’t.\\nI think about AI as a tool. Talking about plain language, when you use Word or Google Docs, I bet if you see a red squiggly line, you do a double check. You say, “Oh, goodness. I just used the wrong ‘there.’” Grammarly is another tool that says, “Actually, your grammar could be slightly improved.”\\nI’ve actually seen some programs that are specifically for medical writers, that where they’re getting their content from is from the published papers, from the government papers that are available. That, to me, gave me a dose more confidence. I did not start using it regularly. I was just beginning to learn about it.\\nI had a conversation with somebody today who said they were really trying to get some wrong answers from ChatGPT around medical information, and it was all correct.\\nWhat about if we’re making recommendations? Certainly patient education, sometimes it’s tailored to that population. Maybe it’s someone who’s had diabetes for a long time or newly diagnosed with something else. Would the computer be spitting out things for them to do?\\nIt’s the computer saying that, and so it’s the kind of thing, Helen, that if you did that, you’d say, “Actually, that’s pretty good. They are the three things that I would recommend because I’ve seen that in the literature,” or it might not.\\nIs this cheating to use this? I was thinking about it even for my newsletter, when I saw you can now do it with AI, I thought, “I keep working on my nouns and verbs on this, and I’m doing my best.” Is that cheating if I have a computer do that next pass at it for me? Is that cheating if we do it with plain language or health content?\\nThis is a great question. I would say if you wrote something, Helen, and then you put it through ChatGPT and it tightened things up slightly or it maybe shifted the grade level, I don’t think that’s cheating.\\nAre there official ways to cite that now? I have not seen that.\\nNo. We’re working it out. It’s a lot of conversations around college campuses about this.\\nEw.\\nThat’s the thing. How do we feel about the use of ChatGPT in different contexts? If you’re putting out a newsletter and you start saying, “I don’t write this. This is just ChatGPT,” I’m going to lose trust in you.\\nI’m writing down your tips here. It’s a tool like anything else. We’re just more aware of it now than we were before, because it’s right out there and it’s more available to the public than it ever was before.\\nWe haven’t really talked about the dark sides of AI. It’s great to have a positive conversation about it, but there are fears about the ways in which ChatGPT could be weaponized.\\nWe can create voices, too, right?\\nIt can create voices. We have to be aware of that. I would say as people who are working in this space of education and literacy, we should also be talking to our communities about this, about the ways in which AI can potentially cause harm.\\nI’m so glad I’m talking to you. I feel like I’m a few steps behind. Just today, I wanted to look up some medical thing, so I went to Dr. Google. I’ve gotten much more comfortable about that. Years ago, I would not be that comfortable. I know you can’t trust things on the internet, but I know how to vet that myself and go to the sites that I find credible.\\nOne hundred percent.\\nWays to learn more. I wrote down a few sites that you mentioned. I’m going to add them to your Health Literacy Out Loud web page. Is there any example or reference that you want people absolutely to know right now?\\nI wish that there was a go-to resource. One thing I’ll say is if you see headlines, read about it. Don’t have your head in the sand. This technology is moving at such speed that if you and I had this conversation in six months’ time, Helen, it might even look very different again.\\nOh, you’re wonderful. I think that you told me a while ago you actually had something in The New York Times about using this. I want to be able to see that and share that, if we can. We’ll have a link on your Health Literacy Out Loud web page. Can you just give us a little overview of what that is?\\nIn 2019, The New York Times asked me to talk about deep fakes, which is artificial intelligence as a way to create videos, and they turned me into Adele.\\nThe singer Adele?\\nYes, the singer. The first 30 seconds, you think you’re hearing from Adele, and then it morphs back into me and I say, “Actually, I’m Claire Wardle.”\\nI certainly can’t wait to see that. Claire, I learned so much from you. Thank you, thank you, thank you for teaching me, teaching all of us and I think maybe making me a little more confident to try this a little bit more, but also appreciate the downsides. AI is just a tool. We’ve learned to manage our other tools.\\nExactly.\\nThank you for being a guest on Health Literacy Out Loud.\\nIt was my pleasure.\\nAs we just heard from Claire Wardle, it’s important to appreciate all the new tools that are coming our way, including artificial intelligence. But doing so is not always easy.'"

I’ve gotten much more comfortable about that. Years ago, I would not be that comfortable.

            "Oh, you’re wonderful. I think that you told me a while ago you actually had something in The New York Times about using this. I want to be able to see that and share that, if we can. We’ll have a link on your Health Literacy Out Loud web page. Can you just give us a little overview of what that is?\n",

Thank you, thank you, thank you for teaching me, teaching all of us and I think maybe making me a little more confident to try this a little bit more, but also appreciate the downsides. AI is just a tool. We’ve learned to manage our other tools.\n",
